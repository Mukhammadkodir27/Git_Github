git status

make the changes(create a file, edit the file save the file)
git add .   -> this is for all files or
git add text.txt text1.pdf text1.docx

The Master Branch

In git, we are always working on a branch*
It is default branch name is master.
It does not do anything special or have fancy 
powers. It is just like any other branch.

Head is our current location that we are viewing or checking in our repository
//So far, Head always points to the latest commit you made on the master branch
Head is the thing that's currently open and we are checking out

Viewing branches

use  git branch to view all your existing branches
* indicates the branch that you are currently on
